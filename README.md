# Time-series-prediction-analysis

Aquaculture forecasting and monitoring time series prediction using vector auto regression and neural network layout.
The project consisted in predicting the appropriate Dissolved Oxygen level few hours in advance for 168 models, using the downloaded sensor datasets as a reference for training.
